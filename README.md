# TeX's Music Mezcla - Creative Vocal Blender

TeX's Music Mezcla is a standalone audio mixing application that allows you to blend multiple vocal tracks with an instrumental track directly in your browser. All audio processing happens client-side using the Web Audio API, so no backend or internet connection is required after the initial load.

## Features

- Blend multiple vocal tracks together with a crossfader
- Apply various audio effects (reverb, delay, distortion, tremolo)
- Auto-pilot modes for automatic blending
- Real-time audio-reactive visualization
- Master volume controls for all tracks

## Run Locally

Simply double-click the `run.bat` file in the project folder. This will:
1. Install dependencies if needed
2. Build the application
3. Start a local server
4. The application will be available at http://localhost:4173

### Method 2: Manual setup

**Prerequisites:** Node.js
